== Usage ==

=== Adding Open vSwitch Endpoint ===

Use the following steps to start monitoring Open vSwitch using the Zenoss web interface.

# Navigate to the Infrastructure page. [[File:openvswitch_add_menu.png|thumb|320px|Add Menu Item]]
# Choose ''Add a Single Device...'' from the add device button.<br clear=all>
# Fill out the form. [[File:openvswitch_add_dialog.png|thumb|320px|Add Dialog]]
#* ''Name or IP'' must be either the IP address for the Open vSwitch host, or a FQDN that can be resolved to the host IP address.
#* ''Title'' can be anything you want.
# Select ''/Network/OpenvSwitch'' from the dropdown list for Device Class
# Click ''ADD''.

To start monitoring your Open vSwitch server you will need to setup SSH access so that your Zenoss collector server will be able to SSH into your Open vSwitch server(s) as a user who has permission to run the ovs-vsctl command, and /var/run/openvswitch/db.sock. This almost always means the root user. See the Using a Non-Root User section below for instructions on allowing non-root users to run Open vSwitch.
zCommandUsername
zCommandPassword
zKeyPath
The zCommandUsername property must be set. To use public key authentication you must verify that the public portion of the key referenced in zKeyPath is installed in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the appropriate user on the Open vSwitch server. If this key has a passphrase you should set it in the zCommandPassword property. If you'd rather use password authentication than setup keys, simply put the user's password in the zCommandPassword property.
You should then add the zenoss.ssh.OpenvSwitch modeler plugin to the device, or device class containing your Open vSwitch servers and remodel the device(s).

=== Using a Non-Root User ===
This ZenPack requires the ability to run the ''ovs-vsctl'' command and ''ovs-ofctl'' command remotely on your Open vSwitch server(s) using SSH. By default, these commands are only allowed to be run by the '''root''' user. Furthermore, this ZenPack expects these commands be in the user's path. Normally this is only true for the root user.

Assuming that you've created a user named '''zenmonitor''' on your Open vSwitch servers for monitoring purposes, you can follow these steps to allow the '''zenmonitor''' user to run ''ovs-vsctl'' command and ''ovs-ofctl'' command.

# Install the '''sudo''' package on your server.
# Allow the *zenmonitor* user to run ovs-vsctl, ovs-ofctl.
## Run ''visudo'' as root.
## Add the following line to the bottom of the file.
##: zenmonitor ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ovs-vsctl, /usr/sbin/ovs-ofctl
## Type ''ESC'' then '':wq'' to save the sudo configuration.
# Allow *zenmonitor* to execute commands via ssh without a TTY.
## Run ''visudo'' as root.
## Find the line containing ''zenmonitor ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ovs-vsctl, /usr/sbin/ovs-ofctl''.
## Add this line underneath it:
##: Defaults:zenmonitor        !requiretty
## Type ''ESC'' then '':wq'' to save the sudo configuration.


== Zenoss Analytics ==

This ZenPack provides additional support for Zenoss Analytics. Perform the
following steps to install extra reporting resources into Zenoss Analytics
after installing the ZenPack.

# Copy analytics-bundle.zip from $ZENHOME/ZenPacks/ZenPacks.zenoss.OpenvSwitch/analytics/ on your Zenoss server.
# Navigate to Zenoss Analytics in your browser.
# Login as superuser.
# Remove any existing ''OpenvSwitch ZenPack'' folder.
## Choose ''Repository'' from the ''View'' menu at the top of the page.
## Expand ''Public'' in the list of folders.
## Right-click on ''OpenvSwitch ZenPack'' folder and choose ''Delete''.
## Confirm deletion by clicking ''OK''.
# Add the new ''OpenvSwitch ZenPack'' folder.
## Choose ''Server Settings'' from the ''Manage' menu at the top of the page.
## Choose ''Import'' in the left page.
## Remove checks from all check boxes.
## Click ''Choose File'' to import a data file.
## Choose the analytics-bundle.zip file copied from your Zenoss server.
## Click ''Import''.
## Click Close to close Import page

You can now navigate back to the ''OpenvSwitch ZenPack'' folder in the repository to see the following resources added by the bundle.

;Domains
* OpenvSwitch Domain

Domains can be used to create ad hoc views using the following steps.

# Choose ''Ad Hoc View'' from the ''Create'' menu.
# Click ''Domains'' at the top of the data chooser dialog.
# Expand ''Public'' then ''OpenvSwitch ZenPack''.
# Choose the ''OpenvSwitch Domain'' domain.
